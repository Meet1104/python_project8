# 📊 NumPy Analyzer

A Python-based toolkit for performing array manipulations, mathematical operations, and statistical analysis using **NumPy**, implemented using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

---

## 🚀 Objective

Develop a NumPy Analyzer that integrates NumPy functionalities with OOP to allow users to:

- Perform common data operations
- Conduct statistical analyses
- Execute mathematical computations on 1D, 2D, or 3D NumPy arrays

---

## 🛠️ Features & Requirements

### 🔹 Class and Object Structure
- A class `DataAnalytics` encapsulates all functionalities and array operations.

### 🔹 Array Management
- **Creation, Indexing, and Slicing**: Supports 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays.
- **Combining and Splitting**: Concatenate or split arrays.

### 🔹 Mathematical Operations
- Element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Dot product and matrix multiplication

### 🔹 Search, Sort, and Filter
- Search specific values
- Sort arrays (ascending/descending)
- Filter arrays using user-defined conditions

### 🔹 Aggregating Functions
- Sum, Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, Variance

### 🔹 Statistical Functions
- Minimum and Maximum values
- Percentiles
- Correlation Coefficients

## 👨‍💻 Object-Oriented Approach

- Uses **constructors** to initialize arrays
- Encapsulates logic with **private methods**
- Implements **@classmethod** and **@staticmethod** where needed

---

## 🧑‍💻 User Interface

A **menu-driven console application** that enables:

- Easy selection of operations
- Array creation and analysis
- Option to exit from the main menu
